========================================
HOWTO: Run the Generic Hall C Analyzer 
========================================


1) Open 'set_basic_cuts.inp' file to set the ROOTfile and REPORTfile
   directory path and name pattern.

   In this file, you may also set BCM type, daq triggre to analyze,
   tracking efficiency cuts definitions, and basic data analysis cuts


2) Open 'set_basic_histos.inp' file to set histograms of interest
   number of bins and range.


3) Open 'main.cpp' file to ensure that the correct 'run_list.txt'
   file is being read, as the analyzer will loop over all runs
   in the file. Also, make sure to understand the initialization
   parameters taken by the baseAnalyzer.


4) Run: root -l main.cpp


NOTE: Currently, the code is ONLY set up to analyze coincidence mode daq
and only experimental data. The code needs to be updated to analyze SIMC
as well.

5) Assuming "coin" and "data" have been used as initialization parameters,
   the code will loop over each run, which will be corrected for
   inefficiencies and normalized by the total charge. The code will output
   the following:

   --> basic_data_histos_RunNumber.root (charge normalized, inefficiency corrected histos)
   --> basic_data_histos_combined.root (combined histograms which have been added bin-by-bin for each run)
   --> basic_data__report.txt (a report file with relevant information for each run, such as charge, current, ineffieiencies, rates, etc.)


IMPORTANT:  NOTE THAT THIS CODE ASSUMES THAT THE USER HAS ALREADY COMPILED A LIST
	    OF RUNS CORRESPONDING TO A SPECIFIC KINEMATICS (NO SPECTROMETER CHANGE)
	    AND ALL RUNS WILL BE COMBINED TO GAIN BETTER STATISTICS.

	    IF THE USER ONLY WANTS TO ANALYZE A SINGLE RUN, SIMPLY INPUT A SINGLE RUN
	    NUMBER IN THE RUN LIST.
