** General PID and acceptance cuts are made. The yield is not
corrected for any inefficiency yet, as one needs to determine the
contributions from the + and - helicity states and see if they are
significantly different that a correction should be included in

Asy = (N+_corr - N-_corr) / (N+_corr + N-_cprr):  N+_corr =  N+/(efficiencies) same for N-

** The files in the KIN-/ directories contain the final th_xq_CM_vs_ph_xq for + and - helicities
from which the asymmetry can be extracted.


These histogramas have the following event selection cuts:
(which may vary for different kinematics)

** Acceptance CUTS:  HMS_delta: (-8,8) %, SHMS_delta: (-10,22)  --> same for all KIN-directories

** Coincidence Time Cuts (Kaon, Pion, Protons): Varies depending on the width of the peak

** Coin. Time Cut (outside the main peak, to select randoms): the cut is +/- 5 * Coincidence time cut on the main peak
NOTE: Missing Mass and the th_xq_CM_vs_ph_xq histograms are analyzed with a real coincidence and randoms coincidence selection
cuts in order to carry out the randoms subtraction.  The randoms histograms are scaled down accordingly before they are subtracted
from the spectra formed from the real coincidences.

** Missing Mass Cut (Kaon, Pion, Protons): More or less, a cut is made to select the missing particle:
MM_Kaon : (1.05, 1.15)  --> Select the missing lambda from reaction H(e,e'K+)Lambda
MM_Pion : (0.89, 0.98) --> Select the missing neutron from reaction H(e,e'Pi+)neutron
MM_Proton:  Not so sure about this . . .
