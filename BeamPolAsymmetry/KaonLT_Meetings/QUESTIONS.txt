This .txt file contains a list of questions I have about beam polarization,
polarimetry detectors, and physics/analysis of beam-spin asymmetry.

--Polarimetry--
The Moller / Compton polarimeters in Hall C are clearly
invasive to the beam, since they require the beam to be scattered
by a specific target material.

1) How often in a run-period must Moller measurements be taken?

2) When the measurements determine the averge beam polarization,
   are these average values used for the entire run period? What
   if the acelerator changes beam energy? What factors, apart from
   beam energy changes, can affet the beam polarization such that the
   polarization measurements need to be done again?

3) What is the Half-Wave Plate used for? flipping the quartet structure of
polarized beam

4) What is the Wien filter used for? (selecting electrons with
   a specific velocity?) The Wein filter is set once per run period
