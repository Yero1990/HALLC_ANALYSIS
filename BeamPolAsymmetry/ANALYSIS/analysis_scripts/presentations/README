Presentation 1: Hall C Meeting

** Present 1st Pass of Beam-Spin Asymmetry:
** Analyzed 8 kinematics of the Kaon LT (2018) -- for 100k events / run
** Best statistics were KIN-2, KIN-5 and KIN-7 for Kaons and Pions 
** Show the event selection cuts for KIN-7 along with the corresponding
   asymmmetry

** Then show the rest of the asymmetries for Kaons and Pions
