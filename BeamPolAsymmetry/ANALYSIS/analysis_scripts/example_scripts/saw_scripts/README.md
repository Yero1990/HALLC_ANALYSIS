This directory contains useful starting scripts written by Steve Wood.
The scripts are used to extract the beam asymmetry. There is
also a run list indicating when the Insertable Half-Wave Plate (IHWP) was
used in the Injector. If the IHWP was used, then the sign of the helicity
signal must be reversed.
