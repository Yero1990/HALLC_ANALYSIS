This directory contains example C++ code that shows how
multiple .cpp files and their corresponding .h files can
be utilized by a main code, main.cpp.

This example is helpful when building large C++ projects that
require multiple .cpp files that must work together in a single
main.cpp steering code.

In this example, the concept of composition is introduced,
which consists of using object of other classes into your
own class. Also, the concept of friend is introduced, which is
used by your class to make friend with another function or class,
basically enabling that other [funct. or class] access to the member
functions of your class.

To compile using the g++ compiler, do:

1. This links all the .cpp files together and creates an executable main
>> g++ main.cpp People.cpp Birthday.cpp -o main
>> ./main
